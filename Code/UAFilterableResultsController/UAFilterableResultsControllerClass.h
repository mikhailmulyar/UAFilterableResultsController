/**
 * UAFilterableResultsController
 *
 * It acts as a UITableViewDataSource for a UITableView, or UICollectionViewDataSource for a UICollectionView.
 * You can supply a single or two dimensional NSArray as the data. Then assign an instance of this class as your
 * table or collection view's data source.
 *
 * It will instruct the table to layout sections and rows based on your supplied data.
 *
 * You can manipulate the data arrays and the UITableViewController/UICollectionViewController will be notified of the changes
 * via your supplied delegate, in a manner akin to NSFetchedResultsController.
 *
 * You can also provide non-destructive filters to the data using NSPredicates. The UITableView
 * is notified of the filtered changes via your delegate, allowing you to animate the application or
 * removal of the filters.
 *
 * Additionally, if you specify the primaryKeyPath, UAFilterableResultsController will attempt to complete operations
 * by comparing the value at the specified key path, instead of using raw isEqual:.

 * by this kay path matches. Set this to nil to rely purely on isEqual:.
